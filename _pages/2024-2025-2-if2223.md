### Description
The course “Operating Systems” discusses operating systems comprehensively, including their functioning, modification, and process management in general. This course is divided into three main sections.

The first part of the course covers concurrency: how to manage multiple tasks running simultaneously and sharing resources. Topics in this section include processes and threads, context switching, synchronization, scheduling, and deadlock.

The second part of the course addresses memory management issues; this section will cover topics such as linking, dynamic memory allocation, dynamic address translation, virtual memory, and demand paging.

The third main part of the course focuses on file systems, including topics such as storage devices, disk management and scheduling, directories, protection, and crash recovery.

After these three main topics, the course will conclude with some smaller topics, such as virtual machines.
### Learning Outcomes
